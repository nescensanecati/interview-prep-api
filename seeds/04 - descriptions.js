HTML allows web developers to structure the content on a web page and define how elements on the page should be displayed in web browsers. It consists of various tags and attributes that describe the structure and presentation of text, images, links, forms, and other elements on a web page.`},
      {description_id:2, question_id:2, description:`In HTML, the "html" element is used to define the structure of an HTML document. It serves as the root element of an HTML page and contains all the other HTML elements that make up the document.

      {description_id:6, question_id:6, description:`To insert a line break within a paragraph in HTML, you can use the "br" tag. The "br" tag is an empty or self-closing tag, which means it doesn't have a closing tag. When you use it within a paragraph ("p") or any other block-level element, it causes the content that follows it to appear on a new line.`},
      {description_id:7, question_id:7, description:`In HTML, you can comment out multiple lines of code using the "!-- and --" comment delimiters.

      {description_id:28, question_id:28, description:`The default value of the "position" property in CSS is "static." When an element's position property is set to "static," it follows the normal document flow, and its position on the web page is determined by the order in which it appears in the HTML markup. Elements with a "static" position are not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties, nor are they affected by the "z-index" property.`},
      {description_id:29, question_id:29, description:`The CSS property used to add space outside the border of an element is the margin property.

When multiple CSS rules compete to style an element, the rule with the highest specificity is applied.`},
      {description_id:35, question_id:35, description:`The CSS property used to hide an element but reserve space for it in the layout is visibility with the value hidden. When you set the visibility property to hidden, the element becomes invisible, but it still occupies space in the layout as if it were visible. In other words, the element is hidden from view, but the space it occupies remains intact.`},
      {description_id:36, question_id:36, description:`The CSS property used to create a shadow effect behind an element is the box-shadow property. The box-shadow property allows you to add shadows to elements, creating depth and dimension in your web design.`},

They are defined using the @mixin directive and can be included in your SCSS code using the @include directive.`},
      {description_id:47, question_id:47, description:`The @extend directive in SCSS is used to share styles between selectors. It allows one selector to inherit the styles of another selector, promoting the reuse of CSS properties and ensuring that your generated CSS remains DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).`},
      {description_id:48, question_id:48, description:`In SCSS, the data type that represents a collection of values is called a "List."

      {description_id:50, question_id:50, description:`In SCSS, the !default flag when defining variables serves a specific purpose. When you declare a variable with the !default flag, it indicates that if the variable hasn't been previously defined, the default value will be assigned to it. However, if the variable has already been defined elsewhere in your SCSS code, the existing value will be retained, and the default value won't overwrite it.`},

      {description_id:53, question_id:53, description:`In SCSS, the @mixin directive is used to define reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included (or "mixed in") within other selectors or rules using the @include directive. Mixins are a way to encapsulate a set of CSS properties and their values so that they can be easily reused throughout your stylesheets. This promotes modularity and helps you avoid duplicating code.`},
      {description_id:54, question_id:54, description:`The @for directive in SCSS allows you to create loops and generate CSS rules dynamically based on specific conditions. It provides a way to iterate over a range of values, perform calculations, and generate CSS code accordingly.`},
