      {description_id:1, question_id:1, description:`HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language." It is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. HTML allows web developers to structure the content on a web page and define how elements on the page should be displayed in web browsers. It consists of various tags and attributes that describe the structure and presentation of text, images, links, forms, and other elements on a web page.`},
      {description_id:2, question_id:2, description:`In HTML, the "html" element is used to define the structure of an HTML document. It serves as the root element of an HTML page and contains all the other HTML elements that make up the document. The opening "html" tag is placed at the beginning of the document, and the closing "/html" tag is placed at the end.`},
      {description_id:3, question_id:3, description:`The correct HTML tag for creating an ordered list is the "ol" element. An ordered list is used to display a list of items in a specific order, such as a numbered list. Each item within the list is typically marked with a number (or another ordered marker, depending on the list type).`},
      {description_id:4, question_id:4, description:`The HTML tag used for creating a hyperlink is the "a" (anchor) element. The "a" element is used to define a hyperlink that allows users to navigate to another web page, a specific location within the same page, or an external resource like a file or an email address.`},
      {description_id:5, question_id:5, description:`The HTML "meta" tag is used to provide metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is information about the data within the document, rather than the content of the document itself. The "meta" tag is typically placed within the "head" section of an HTML document and does not have a closing tag.`},
      {description_id:6, question_id:6, description:`To insert a line break within a paragraph in HTML, you can use the "br" tag. The "br" tag is an empty or self-closing tag, which means it doesn't have a closing tag. When you use it within a paragraph ("p") or any other block-level element, it causes the content that follows it to appear on a new line.`},
      {description_id:7, question_id:7, description:`In HTML, you can comment out multiple lines of code using the "!-- and --" comment delimiters. Anything placed between these delimiters will be treated as a comment and will not be rendered by the web browser.

      {description_id:10, question_id:10, description:`To specify the character encoding for an HTML document, you should use the charset attribute within a "meta" tag in the "head" section of your HTML document. The most commonly used character encoding for modern web documents is UTF-8, which can handle a wide range of characters from various languages.`},
      {description_id:11, question_id:11, description:`To create a hyperlink that allows users to send an email when clicked, you can use the "a" (anchor) element with the mailto: URL scheme. The mailto: scheme specifies that clicking the link will open the default email client on the user's device and populate the recipient's email address, subject, and other optional fields.`},
      {description_id:12, question_id:12, description:`The HTML element used to define a table row is the "tr" element. In HTML, tables are structured using a combination of elements, and the "tr" element is used to create a single row within a table. `},
      {description_id:13, question_id:13, description:`The HTML "div" element, which stands for "division," is a generic container element used to group and structure content within an HTML document. Its primary purpose is to divide the content into sections or groups, which can then be targeted for styling, layout, or JavaScript manipulation. The "div" element does not provide any specific visual formatting or semantic meaning on its own but is a fundamental building block for creating structured and organized web pages. `},
      {description_id:14, question_id:14, description:`The HTML tag used to define a bulleted list is the "ul" element, which stands for "unordered list."

      {description_id:27, question_id:27, description:`To select an element with the ID "example" in CSS, you can use the ID selector, which is denoted by a hash symbol (#) followed by the ID name. `},
      {description_id:28, question_id:28, description:`The default value of the "position" property in CSS is "static." When an element's position property is set to "static," it follows the normal document flow, and its position on the web page is determined by the order in which it appears in the HTML markup. Elements with a "static" position are not affected by the top, bottom, left, or right properties, nor are they affected by the "z-index" property.`},
      {description_id:29, question_id:29, description:`The CSS property used to add space outside the border of an element is the margin property. The margin property controls the space between the border of an element and other elements in the layout.

      {description_id:34, question_id:34, description:`CSS specificity determines which CSS rules are applied when multiple conflicting rules target the same element. Specificity is a way of measuring the weight or importance of a CSS selector in relation to other selectors. When multiple CSS rules compete to style an element, the rule with the highest specificity is applied.`},
      {description_id:35, question_id:35, description:`The CSS property used to hide an element but reserve space for it in the layout is visibility with the value hidden. When you set the visibility property to hidden, the element becomes invisible, but it still occupies space in the layout as if it were visible. In other words, the element is hidden from view, but the space it occupies remains intact.`},
      {description_id:36, question_id:36, description:`The CSS property used to create a shadow effect behind an element is the box-shadow property. The box-shadow property allows you to add shadows to elements, creating depth and dimension in your web design.`},

It's similar to the CSS @import rule but specifically designed for SCSS files.`},
      {description_id:45, question_id:45, description:`In SCSS, the $ symbol is used to indicate the declaration of a variable. When you declare a variable in SCSS, you use the $ symbol followed by the variable name to assign a value to it.`},
      {description_id:46, question_id:46, description:`The SCSS feature that allows you to reuse blocks of styles across your stylesheet is called "Mixins." Mixins are a powerful way to define reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in multiple selectors or rules. They are defined using the @mixin directive and can be included in your SCSS code using the @include directive.`},
      {description_id:47, question_id:47, description:`The @extend directive in SCSS is used to share styles between selectors. It allows one selector to inherit the styles of another selector, promoting the reuse of CSS properties and ensuring that your generated CSS remains DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).`},
      {description_id:48, question_id:48, description:`In SCSS, the data type that represents a collection of values is called a "List." A list is an ordered collection of values, and it can contain various types of data, such as numbers, strings, or other lists. Lists in SCSS are typically enclosed in parentheses and have values separated by commas.`},
      {description_id:49, question_id:49, description:`In SCSS, you can comment out a single line of code using two forward slashes //. Anything after // on the same line will be treated as a comment and will not be compiled into the CSS output.`},
      {description_id:50, question_id:50, description:`In SCSS, the !default flag when defining variables serves a specific purpose. When you declare a variable with the !default flag, it indicates that if the variable hasn't been previously defined, the default value will be assigned to it. However, if the variable has already been defined elsewhere in your SCSS code, the existing value will be retained, and the default value won't overwrite it.`},
      {description_id:51, question_id:51, description:`In SCSS, the + operator is used for concatenating strings. You can use the + operator to combine or concatenate multiple strings into a single string.`},
      {description_id:52, question_id:52, description:`The SCSS code border: 1px solid darken(#3498db, 10%); generates a CSS border declaration with a color that is 10% darker than the color #3498db.`},
      {description_id:53, question_id:53, description:`In SCSS, the @mixin directive is used to define reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included (or "mixed in") within other selectors or rules using the @include directive. Mixins are a way to encapsulate a set of CSS properties and their values so that they can be easily reused throughout your stylesheets. This promotes modularity and helps you avoid duplicating code.`},
      {description_id:54, question_id:54, description:`The @for directive in SCSS allows you to create loops and generate CSS rules dynamically based on specific conditions. It provides a way to iterate over a range of values, perform calculations, and generate CSS code accordingly.`},
      {description_id:55, question_id:55, description:`In SCSS, you can use the random() function to generate a random number. The random() function generates a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1. You can use it to create random variations in your styles or calculations.`},
      {description_id:56, question_id:56, description:`The @if directive in SCSS is used for conditional logic. It allows you to conditionally apply styles based on specified conditions. This means you can apply different styles to an element depending on whether a particular condition is true or false.`},
      {description_id:57, question_id:57, description:`The SCSS feature that allows you to group related styles together for better organization is "Nesting." Nesting in SCSS allows you to write CSS rules in a hierarchical and more structured manner, similar to the structure of your HTML elements.`},
